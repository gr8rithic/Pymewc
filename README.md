- Pymewc is a new and innovative python library that can be used for connecting python with the microcontroller world.
- Pymewc is a lightweight package that aims simplicity yet performing complex tasks with ease.

## Features

- Read data from each pin of the microcontroller
- Read data printed on the serial monitor window
- Scoping Using Analog Pin 0 with a accuracy of upto 100 Hz
- Writing program to the microcontroller(Development Stage)
- Sending data to the local cloud service / running a apache server(Development Stage)

## Installation

Pymewc requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.6+ to run.  But extensively tested and recomends using python version > 3.7

Install the dependencies and packages and thats it.

### For windows

```sh
pip install pymewc
```

#### For linux and unix based Operating systems


**Downloading pip on linux based operating systems**

Debian and Debian Based distros(Ubuntu, Mint etc)

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

For Arch and Arch Based distros(Manjaro, Endevour etc)

```sh
sudo  pacman -S python-pip
```

Installing package using pip

```sh
pip3 install pymewc
```

## How to use the package

**To check whether the python package is working and responding perfectly**

```sh
import pymewc
pymewc.hello()
```

**To make the LED blink with time delay**

```sh
import pymewc
pymewc.blink()
```

**For printing what the serial monitor prints:**

```sh
import pymewc
pymewc.serial() 
```
**For printing what the serial monitor prints without infinity loop condition specify no. of data to be displayed:**
```sh
import pymewc
pymewc.serial_discrete() 
```

**For scoping using analog pin A0 (Currently default value is A0 other analog pin values are under development) :**

```sh
import pymewc
pymewc.scope()
```

*Adding few other features which are digitalRead and digitalWrite functionalites(In development will be live soon)*


## Development Going on

- Working on autodetect port name
- Digital read and write functionalities for microcontrollers
- Arduino scoping for other analog pins
- Multiple scoping at the same time

## Want to help??

Want to contribute? Great!

I will always welcome everyone contributers to contribute to the project which will be live soon. Hope it hits the market hard
